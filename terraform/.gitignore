# Exclude files generated by Terraform during initialization and runtime.

# This includes local state and remote configuration files.

# Exclude terraform's local crash log file
crash.log

# Exclude dependency lock file if you're using Terraform v0.14+
# This file tracks provider versions. You might WANT to commit this if
# your team is standardizing on versions, but ignoring it ensures
# everyone can run `terraform init` without conflicts.
# The safe bet is usually to IGNORE it unless you have a specific reason to track.
.terraform.lock.hcl

# --- Configuration and Credentials ---
# Exclude auto-generated or temporary files, and potential sensitive configuration.

# Exclude any override files you might use for local testing (e.g., to override variables)
# If you are using override files, you likely want to ignore these!
override.tf
override.tf.json
*_override.tf
*_override.tf.json

# Exclude variable definition files that might contain sensitive data or be
# specific to a local environment.
# Note: DO NOT ignore your main 'variables.tf' file! Only ignore specific value files.
*.tfvars
*.tfvars.json

# Exclude auto-generated files like the plan output
# (though you might commit this in advanced CI/CD pipelines)
*.plan

# Exclude local provider configurations if using a custom provider path
# $HOME/.terraform.d/plugins/

# --- Operating System/Editor Files (Good practice for any project) ---
# Ignore common editor and OS files to keep the repo clean.
